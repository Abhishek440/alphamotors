 			<gri>"Experience pure steering response in a car that generates powerful downforces directly from its body panels." When Peugeot designers and sport engineers teamed up to create an exceptional super car the result was Peugeot Vision Gran Turismo. This racing car specially designed for the Anniversary Edition of Gran Turismo 6, brings together the major element of a hyper efficient endrance car. Boasting a radical style, the PEUGEOT Vision Gran Turismo stands out with its almost absent aerodynamic elements and its ait-rending monolithic figure. Its design allows an aerodynamic support directly generated by the car bodywork, which reaches a mere 1.04m.

 		<h1> Description </h1>
 			Tesla's Cybertruck is one of the most polarizing automobile designs to debut in decades. In fact, you could say it's driving a wedge between the various factions of the automotive community. Some people think it looks brutal, aggressive and rugged like some kind of electric, dystopian Matrix bro-dozer. Others think it looks like something that Ikea might offer as its first slat-pack vechile. Tesla's Cyber truck will be offered in three different trim levels, each with a different powertrain. The nse model will feature a single motor and a range of around 250 miles. Cybertruck is built with an exterior shell made for ultimate durability and passenger protection.

 		<gri>Anyone seeking an executive sedan that offers convenience and tecgnological innovation in large quantites should take a hard look at the 2020 Audi A8. Although some of its leading-edge tech features haven's yet made it to the USA, this is a very advance car that simplifies the act of driving, while its lavish cabin shields yo from the chaos of your commute. It's also preety entertaining for an extra-large sedan (Audi sells only the long-wheelbase A8 version on our shores), thanks to exceptionally precise steering and imperssive grip through corners. If there's anything not to like, it might be the car's all-business asthethics. Rivals have more character-in some cases, a lot more. If you're okay with that, the Audi A8 is a fine choice for an elite luxary sedan.</gri>

 			 <h1>Description</h1>
 			The 2020 Rolls-Royce Phantom is not just an ultimate status symbol, it's the Holy Grail of handcrafted luxury automobiles. Its imposing design and decadent furnishings are derived from decades of building opulent motorcars for the world's wealthiest clients. It utilizes a modern aluminum structure that rides atop an air suspension for euphoric comfort. The Phantom has few true rivals, as even the Mercedes-Maybach S650 and the Bentley Mulsanne fail to deliver the same levels of sybaritic luxury, and the Mercedes sports a price tag that's $250,000 less. How proletarian. Want to show the world you've arrived? You need a Phantom. Rolls-Royce's flagship sedan receives three embellishments for 2020: A polished metal fuel filler cap, a new optional Bespoke dash clock, and the option of personalized door-panel embroidery.
